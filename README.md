Consider a capacitor composed of two parallel, rectangular, conductive plates, as presented in
lecture. Assume that upper and lower plates are at potentials V1 = 1 V and V2 = -1 V, and have
same characteristic dimensions a = 1 m and b = 2 m. Subdivide each of the plates into n * m
number of patches, where n = 10 and m = 20. If d is the distance between two plates, find and
plot:
(1) total charge Qcomputational on the positively-charged plate and
(2) the ratio of Canalytical/Ccomputational
for d/a ratios of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 10. Qcomputational is MATLAB-calculated (numerical) total charge,
Ccomputational is MATLAB-calculated (numerical) capacitance, while Canalytical is the value for same
capacitor, but calculated as in example 2.11 in the textbook.
